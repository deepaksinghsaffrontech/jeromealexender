                     <p>In order to activate your conversion sections of your Google Analytics dashboard you have to:</p>
                     <ul>

                           <p> a. Enable Ecommerce </p>

                        <li>
                           <p> c. Add Checkout Labeling (Funnel Steps). Each store can have different checkout steps, so make sure to identify your checkout steps using GTM debugger (GTM container preview) before adding them here in order to avoid wrong tracking. Here is a common Magento checkout funnel example:</p>
                           <ul>
                              <li> Shipping </li>
                              <li> Shipping Method</li>
                              <li> Payment and Billing</li>
                           </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>d. Save Ecommerce set-up. </p>

                         If you are just starting out we highly recommend creating everything as described. 
In Magento Admin Panel we are pre-populating each custom dimension with sample indexes for your help. Please make sure that the Custom Dimension scopes and Indexes in Magento match with the ones created in GA. In a fresh GA account, the index number will start from 1 and as you create them will increase sequentially.

An example can be seen in the screenshot in Step 6.

                           This is an example. If you are an advanced GA user, go ahead and set each dimension up as you wish. Just make sure they match with what you have in Magento.

                        <li>
                         As soon as the Custom Dimensions are setup in GA and they are verified to match with Magento, hit the Create tags button in your Magento Admin. This will automatically assign each custom dimension to the appropriate tag in GTM.

                        <ol>
                           <li><p><b>The GTM module is not tracking properly, what can I do?</b></p>
                           <p>The first step would be to make sure you've followed all the configuration steps provided on the product page here: <a href="https://www.weltpixel.com/google-analytics-enhanced-ecommerce-tag-manager-magento-2.html" target="blank">Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce Tag Manager for Magento 2</a>. The second step is to make sure the extension is updated to the latest version, as each new release contains minor bug fixes and performance enhancements.</p></li> 

                           <li><p><b>Where can I download the latest version of the GTM extension?</b><p>
                           <p>As for any purchased extension from weltpixel.com, you can find the latest version under your weltpixel.com account's <em>"My Downloadable Products"</em> section.</p></li>

                           <li><p><b>Does the module track returns and cancelled orders?</b></p>
                           <p>Our extension does not track returns or order cancellations.</p></li> 

                           <li><p><b>Do I need to create a "purchase" tag to track transactions?</b></p>
                           <p>No purchase tag is needed. The automatically generated tags should be sufficient to track transactions. Just make sure you've followed the configurations steps on the product page: <a href="https://www.weltpixel.com/google-analytics-enhanced-ecommerce-tag-manager-magento-2.html" target="blank">Google Analytics Enhanced Ecommerce Tag Manager for Magento 2.</a></p></li> 

                           <li><p><b>Do I need a GTM and GA snippet on every page?</b></p>
                           <p>If you've installed the GTM tags via our automated process, the GA tag is already included in GTM, therefore, it is not needed to have an additional GA tag loaded separately.</p></li>

                           <li><p><b>I already have a GTM with my own tags. Can I keep it and use the new tags as well?</b></p>
                           <p>We suggest creating a separate GTM containter for the new/updated tags, which you can use for production, and copying over the old tags that you may need.</p></li> 

                           <li><p><b>Does the extension handle the implementation of dataLayer?</b></p>
                           <p>Yes. The extension communicates Magento data to GA through data Layer, which is basically the foundation upon which the module is built.</p></li>

                           <li><p><b>The GTM extesion overrides my template design. What can I do?</b></p>
                           <p>We have a very handy article that goes over this specific issue. Take a look at it here: <a href="https://support.weltpixel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115006195028-How-to-solve-compatibility-issues-Google-Tag-Manager-Enhanced-Ecommerce" target="blank">How to solve compatibility issues - Google Tag Manager Enhanced Ecommerce.</a></p></li> 

                           <li><p><b>I've just installed the module, but I can't see any data in GA. Why?</b></p>
                           <p>It can take up to 48 hours for data to start flowing into Google Analytics. In the meantime, double check to make sure the configuration steps from the product page have been followed.</p></li> 

                           <li><p><b>I have Cookie restriction issues with the GTM module on Magento 2.1.x. What can I do to fix this?</b></p>
                           <p>This is a bug specific to Magento 2.1.x. (Github issue#5596). We have an article written specifically to help overcome this.

(Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics cookie fix).</a></p></li>

                           <li><p><b>Does the extension show any data directly in my Magento Admin?</b></p>
                           <p>All reports can be seen and analyzed in the Google Analytics account. There's no section in the Magento Dashboard which allows for tracking.</p></li>

                           <li><p><b>I have an error generating GTM Tags and Variables. What can I do to solve it?</b></p>
                           <p>The domains where the GTM extension connects to create the tags for you automatically are listed below, make sure to allow outgoing connections to this domains or else the tags cannot be created.

                           <li><p><b>I am using the extension on a Magento 2 instance where products can be included in multiple categories (e.g one SKU could be listed under Sale, Trending and Jackets). How does the module decide which of those 3 categories to assign the product to in the Enhanced Ecommerce Categories tab of the Product Performance report in GA?</b></p>
                           <p>The product will be assigned to the first Category, based on how Magento saves this data internally - when a product is assigned to multiple categories, Magento will save the path of this product based on the first assignment. So, if you assign the product first to Jackets, and then Sale and Trending, it will show up under Jacketst in the GA report.</p></li>

                           <li><p><b>How do subcategories work with the module? E.g. If an SKU is in the Sale subcategory under Jackets, does Sale or Jackets feed through to the GA report? Are subcategories and categories reported at at the same level or are subcategories ignored?</b></p>
                           <p>If the product is assigned under Sale from 'Women/Jackets/Sale', the whole category path is sent to GTM until the root path is reached. In this example the category(s) path sent to GTM is 'Women/Jackets/Sale' </p></li>
